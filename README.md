#  Pre-Course Final Project


## What Is The Project About? 
welcome to my project!
I made a [KANBAN](https://github.com/shakederin/kanban-final/tree/Create-Kanban).

KANBAN is a tool that helps organize tasks.

##  What The KANBAN incule?

My KANBAN has 3 sections:

1. TO-DO.
2. IN-PROGRESS.
3. DONE.

## How To Use It?

In each section the user can create a list of test by their current status, by entering
text to the input box and pressing on add tesk button.

He can change the task status by pressing Alt + 1/2/3 buttons while hovering the task.

1- for moving the test to TO-DO LIST
2- for moving the test to IN-PROGRESS LIST
3- for moving the test to DONE LIST

## Did The List Will Saved?

### YES!

All your tasks will save automatically, live. if you will refresh the page or leave,
the KANBAN will restore your taks.

If you will want to use the KANBAN on other devices,
you need to press the SAVE button on the upper left side of the page, to be able
to load them on your other devices by pressing the LOAD button next to it.

## Is Their Other Features To The KANBAN?

### YES!

You can change the content of the task by doubleClick on it, and when leaving the task's box,
it will automatically save it. 

You can find any task, by typing it, or part of it, on the search box on the top lest side of the page.
it will filter the other task out, but dont worry - it wont detele them!
to see the all tasks again, delete the search box.


## If I'll Have More Time I Would Add:

1. Time and date on each mission creation.
2. Scale from 1 to 10 of the importance of the mission - change the color.
3. Delete button to each task.
4. sort button - by: date/importance/name.
5. (change) the appearance of the 'Loding...' time

hope this tool will change your live for the best!
